I discovered my new favourite fact about [my new favourite language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language) recently. I suppose it should be obvious but I hadn't though about it in explicitly these terms.

Given:

{% highlight c %}
char* myStringArray[] = {"Hello", "Goodbye", "Tomatoes"};
int index = 2;
{% endhighlight %}

then the following will print `Tomatoes`:

{% highlight c %}
printf("%s\n", myStringArray[index]);
{% endhighlight %}

and so (this is the bit I hadn't fully realised) will this:

{% highlight c %}
printf("%s\n", index[myStringArray]);
{% endhighlight %}

Good times :)
