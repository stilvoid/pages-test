<h1>Heroes: Building some old code</h1>


<small>tags: <em>arch</em>, <em>linux</em>, <em>games</em>, <em>legacy</em></small>


<p>For the end result of this post, see <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroes/">my AUR package of Heroes</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The other day, something reminded me of a game I used to really enjoy playing back in my early days of getting to know Linux. That game was <a href="http://heroes.sourceforge.net">Heroes</a>. It’s a clone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake/Tron/Nibbles</a> but with some fun additions, a nice graphical style, and some funky visual effects.</p>

<p><img src="http://heroes.sourceforge.net/img/snap5.png" alt="Heroes screenshot" /></p>

<p>So, of course, I immediately decided to install it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>pacman <span class="nt">-Ss</span> heroes</code></pre></figure>

<p>No results. Nothing in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository">AUR</a> either. There is only one other course of action: I’m going to create an AUR package for it!</p>

<p>It looks like the last change to the game was 16 years ago so it could be fun getting it to compile with a modern toolchain.</p>

<h2 id="getting-heroes-to-compile-in-2018">Getting Heroes to compile in 2018</h2>

<p>I put together a basic <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD">PKGBUILD</a> that pulls down the source and data files from the Heroes sourceforge page and then runs:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">./configure
make</code></pre></figure>

<p>Here’s the first of what I’m sure are many failure messages:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">hedlite.c:48:20: error: static declaration of ‘tile_set_img’ follows non-static declaration 
</span><span class="gp"> static a_pcx_image tile_set_img;</span>
<span class="go">                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~
In file included from hedlite.c:44:
const.h:52:20: note: previous declaration of ‘tile_set_img’ was here                        
</span><span class="gp"> extern a_pcx_image tile_set_img, font_deck_img;</span>                                            
<span class="go">                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Some forewarning: it’s been quite some time since I wrote anything serious in C and I was never an expert in it anyway. But I think I know enough to fix this and so just commented out the static declaration as, after poking around in the code a bit, it doesn’t seem like it’s necessary anyway.</p>

<p>Now the compilation succeeds but I get the following error during linking:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">/usr/bin/ld: camera.o: undefined reference to symbol 'sin@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Turns out that for some reason, the developers forgot to include the math<small>(s)</small> library. I’m guessing that perhaps it used to be linked by default in a previous version of GCC.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">LDFLAGS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">-lm</span> ./configure
make</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now it at least compiles correctly! Next up, compiling the data, music, and sound effects packages.</p>

<p>Amazingly, those all worked correctly and I was able to play the game!</p>

<p>However, this game was written a while ago and originally targeted MS-DOS so it has a window size of 320x200 which looks rather ridiculous on my 1920x1080 desktop ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2018-08-14-heroes.png"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2018-08-14-heroes-small.png" alt="Tiny Heroes window screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>So I set about trying to set the default screen mode so that the game starts in full screen…</p>

<p>Fortunately, it looks like this is relatively easy. I just modified a few variables and changed a command line flag from <code class="highlighter-rouge">-F | --full-screen</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">-W | --windowed</code>.</p>

<p>Next up, rather than rely on <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>’s built-in scaling (it looks blurry and weird), I need to enable Heroes’ quadruple flag <code class="highlighter-rouge">-4</code> by default. In fact, I removed all the scaling options and just left it to default to scaling 4-fold as that leaves the game with a resolution of 1280x800 which seems a reasonable default these days. I’m sure I’ll receive bug reports if it’s not ;)</p>

<p>The very last thing I’ve done is to enable the high quality mixer by default and remove the command line option from the game. CPU is a little more abundant now than it was in 2002 ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/heroes-0.21.patch?h=heroes">Here’s my final patch file</a>.</p>

<h2 id="submitting-the-aur-package">Submitting the AUR package</h2>

<p>Things have changed since I last submitted a package to the AUR so here’s a brief writeup - if only to remind myself in future ;)</p>

<p>First step was to update the SSH key in my AUR account as it contained a key from my old machine.</p>

<p>Next up, I added a remote to my repository:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>git remote add aur ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/heroes.git
<span class="nv">$ </span>git fetch aur  <span class="c"># This step causes AUR to create a record for the package</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The next step is to generate AUR’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">.SRCINFO</code> file and rebase it into every commit (AUR requires this).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>git filter-branch <span class="nt">--tree-filter</span> <span class="s2">"makepkg --printsrcinfo &gt; .SRCINFO"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And then push it to the AUR repository:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>git push <span class="nt">-u</span> aur master</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="testing-it-out">Testing it out</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/packer/">packer</a> to make using AUR easier (I’m <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">lazy</a>).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>packer <span class="nt">-S</span> heroes</code></pre></figure>

<p>SUCCESS!</p>

<p>All in all, this wasn’t anywhere near as painful as I’d expected. Time to play some Heroes :D</p>
