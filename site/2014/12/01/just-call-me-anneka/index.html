<h1>Just call me Anneka</h1>


<small>tags: <em>code</em></small>


<p>I had an idea a few days ago to create a Pebble watchface that works like an advent calendar; you get a new christmas-themed picture every day.</p>

<p><del><a href="https://apps.pebble.com/applications/547bad0ffb079735da00007c">Here it is :)</a></del></p>

<p>The fun part however, was that I completely forgot about the idea until today. Family life and my weekly squash commitment meant that I didn’t have a chance to start work on it until around 22:00 and I really wanted to get it into the Pebble store by midnight (in time for the 1st of December).</p>

<p>I submitted the first release at 23:55!</p>

<p>Enjoy :)</p>

<p>I’ll put the source on GitHub soon. Before that, it’s time for some sleep.</p>
